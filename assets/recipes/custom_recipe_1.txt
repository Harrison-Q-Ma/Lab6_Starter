  "recipeInstructions": "In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.&nbsp; In another large bowl, beat butter and sugar together. Add egg, milk, and vanilla and beat until combined, then add flour mixture gradually until just combined. Shape into a disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate 1 hour. When ready to roll, preheat oven to 350\u00ba and line two large baking sheets with parchment.&nbsp;Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out dough until 1/8\u201d thick. Using a ghost cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Re-roll scraps and cut out more cookies.&nbsp;Transfer to prepared baking sheets and freeze for 10 minutes. Bake until edges are lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Place on a wire cooling rack and let cool completely.&nbsp; Meanwhile, make icing:&nbsp;In a medium bowl, combine powdered sugar, corn syrup, milk, and almond extract.&nbsp; Place about 1/4 of icing into a small bowl and dye black with black food coloring.&nbsp; Place about half the&nbsp;white icing in a piping bag fitted with a small round tip and pipe edges around cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thin remaining white icing by adding 1 teaspoon milk at a time until icing runs easily on cookies, but isn't water thin. Place icing in another piping bag with a small round tip and fill in centers of cookies. Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles and to spread icing to help fill any gaps. Let cookies dry until icing is set, 15 minutes.&nbsp; Place black icing in a piping bag with a small round tip and pipe eyes and mouths onto cookies.&nbsp;",
